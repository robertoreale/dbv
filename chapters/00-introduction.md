## Introduction

Working as a DBA requires improving skills in at least two key areas: SQL and database administration.  Usually the paths to do so are separate: in this book we will try to unify them in a coherent manner.

### What is PostgreSQL

Let me quote the official documentation:

> PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that
> uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely
> store and scale the most complicated data workloads. The origins of
> PostgreSQL date back to 1986 as part of the POSTGRES project at the
> University of California at Berkeley and has more than 30 years of active
> development on the core platform.
